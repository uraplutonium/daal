 *  \brief Provides prediction methods depending on the model such as linearregression.Model.
 *         The methods of the class support different computation modes: batch, distributed, and online(see @ref ComputeMode).
 *         Classes that implement specific algorithms of the model based data prediction are derived classes of the Prediction class.
 *         The class additionally provides virtual methods for validation of input and output parameters of the algorithms.
